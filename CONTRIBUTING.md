## Getting Started

This project is built with [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/) so all the instructions to run it locally are the same as the [Qwik documentation](https://qwik.dev/docs/getting-started.html).

### Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory of the project. This file should contain the following environment variables:

```
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://mnubpkhtexuyixzyxtwx.supabase.co
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1udWJwa2h0ZXh1eWl4enl4dHd4Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MDM5NTI5NTIsImV4cCI6MjAxOTUyODk1Mn0.LxAIFHyiEXD-6mVJkwMNxo5I9ifk1KdvlPM4rsglDyQ
```

### Project Structure

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just an extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

Inside your project, you'll see the following directory structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ components/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ routes/
        â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory-based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.
