## Getting Started

When going on vacation or organizing a party, it is often difficult to know who owes what to whom.

You can use this application to list all expenses made by each participant and to know how much each one owes to the others.

### Core features

- Select the number of participants
- Track each expense with a name and a price
- Generate a list of transactions to balance the accounts

### Coming soon

- Save a bill in your browser
- Track all recent bills
- Share a bill with a link
- Create an account to save and retrieve your bills
- Private bills

...and more! You can track the progress in the [open issues](https://github.com/Balastrong/billsplit/issues) and the [project board](https://github.com/users/Balastrong/projects/3/).
